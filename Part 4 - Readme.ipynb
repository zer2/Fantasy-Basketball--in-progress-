    "# Z-scores don’t make good rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "Every fantasy basketball dabbler has come across Z-scores at some point. They are cornerstones of how player value is quantified across categories, allowing for the creation of objective ranking lists based on actual performance. Drafters who are inexperienced or simply don’t have the time to do their own research rely on these rankings to make sensible picks, and even dedicated drafters may use them as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "One might expect that such a widely used metric has a strong theoretical foundation. I certainly did when I first started looking into fantasy basketball rankings. But the reality is that there is not much to support Z-scores besides intuition and years of orthodoxy. \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that while Z-scores are a sensible heuristic, they are fundamentally flawed and far from the optimal ranking system. I wrote a paper to that effect earlier this month, which is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02188). Mathematically inclined readers may be interested in it. The code used to run the simulations that validate the hypothesis are included in this GitHub repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "I realize that the explanation included in the paper is not particularly readable, especially for those with little background in mathematics. Hopefully this readme will provide a more readable explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.\tWhat are Z-scores?\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-scores are a real concept in statistics. They are what happens to a distribution after subtracting the mean (average) and dividing by the standard deviation (how “spread out” the distribution is). Mathematically, $\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. So if a set of numbers has an average of 10 and a standard deviation of 5, $Z(20) = \\frac{20-10}{5} = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation is useful for number crunchers, because it takes a set of numbers that could have any scale and remakes them into a new set centered closely around zero. Z-transformed statistics have predictable properties and are similar to each other, which is helpful in many contexts. Intuitively, fantasy sports could be one of those contexts, because all metrics should be equally important despite having different scales. \n",
    "\n",
    "For use in fantasy basketball, a few modifications are made to basic Z-scores \n",
    "-\tZ-scores should not be calculated using statistics from all NBA players, because most NBA players will never sniff fantasy teams and should be irrelevant. One common fix is to first score players by basic Z-score, then use the top players to re-calculate means and standard deviations. Players are then re-ranked with the updated means and standard deviations. \n",
    "-\tAnother fix is needed for free throw percent and field goal percent. Players who shoot more attempts matter more for these categories, so impact is scaled by number of attempts before the Z-score transformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "After modifications, we have a sensible strategy for scoring players. See below for an animation of what weekly blocking numbers look like after the Z-score transformation\n",

    "### A.\tCategory differentials\n",
    "\n",
    "An important quantity of interest is the difference in category score, e.g. blocks, between two teams. The sign of the difference will determine the winner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Distributions per player can be transformed into category differentials under the assumption that players are chosen randomly. One might except this to be complicated because all the distributions look a little different from each other. Blocks for example have an unusual “long tail,” with many of the league’s blocks come from a small number of elite shot-blockers. One might be concerned that the total blocking numbers for a team may look different than say, the number of points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, all of the categories will look similar in aggregate because of one of the most amazing theorems in mathematics, the central limit theorem. The central limit theorem says that when adding a bunch of random numbers together, their average (or sum) ends up looking a lot like a bell curve, even if the sampled distribution was not a bell curve. To demonstrate, see the below animation on the differential between two teams’ numbers of blocks, where one team has twelve players and the other has eleven"

    "\n",
    "It is easy to find the mean and variance of the category differentials thanks to a nice property that both numbers share. They are additive across multiple variables; that is to say, the mean of a sum is the sum of the means and the variance of a sum is the sum of the variances (technically this isn’t always true because of correlations, but we don’t need to get into that). Note that when subtracting a number its mean is subtracted instead of added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s return to the example where one team has eleven players and the other has twelve. The average differential is team two’s average score minus team one’s average score, which is just one times the mean of the distribution (1.78). Variances are additive so total variance is 23 times the variance, or standard deviation is square root of 23 times the standard deviation squared (6.80). This lines up with empirically calculated values (1.44 and 6.66). \n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s say that the unchosen player has a blocking average of $m_u$. The differential goes down by $m_u$, and nothing happens to the variance, since the player’s score is known. This gives us a formula for the category distribution totals:  \n",
