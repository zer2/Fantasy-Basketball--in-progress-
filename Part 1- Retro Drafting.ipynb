    "# Optimizing fantasy basketball\n",
    "\n",
    "Fantasy basketball is an extremely popular pasttime for nba fans. Participants 'draft' players before the season, then get rewarded for their proxys' in-game performances during the season. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three commonly played standard formats. As described by [ESPN](https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003913632-Scoring-Formats), they are\n",
    "\n",
    ">Rotisserie: Rotisserie, or \"Roto,\" is the most common way to play fantasy basketball. In this scoring type, teams are ranked from first to last in each statistical category. Points are then awarded according to the order in each category and totaled to determine an overall score and league rank.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Head-to-Head: Each Category: H2H Each Category is the most common type of head-to-head play in fantasy basketball. It allows you to select the \"X\" number of statistic categories. For each scoring period, team totals are accumulated and a win, loss or tie is credited in each category based on the matchup results (i.e. 6-3-1 in a 10 category league). If selected, your league will have team schedules/playoffs and you will have the option to set up divisions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Head-to-Head: Most Categories: H2H Most Categories allows you to set \"X\" number of statistic categories. For each scoring period (usually Monday through Sunday) team totals are accumulated in each of the categories. At the end of the scoring period, the winner is determined by which team wins the most number of categories. The end result is a win (1-0-0), loss (0-1-0) or tie (0-0-1). These results correspond directly to each team's overall record. If selected, your league will have team schedules/playoffs and you will have the option to set up divisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common settings specify 9 categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, 3-pointers, field goal %, free throw %, and turnovers. Participants are paired up to compete week-by-week, and at the end of the season, the player with the best record wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "One might note that from a mathematical perspective the first two formats are very similar. In Rotisserie, if you perform better in a category than five other teams and worse than six, you get five points. That is the same reward that you would get if you faced them individually and got points for winning the category. The rotisserie format has less variance because you are effectively facing everyone in one week instead of spread out over several weeks, allowing more total data points. But the mathematical objective remains the same: maximizing the expected number of wins across all categories and opponents. For our purposes, we will therefore only look at H2H and the winner-take-all version, assuming that the H2H strategy will also work for Rotisserie\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the game of basketball helps win fantasy drafts. However, it's not the whole ballgame: even if we had precise probability distributions for player performance beforehand, or exact numbers with no uncertainty, it would not be obvious how to draft correctly. Do we want to optimize for all nine categories, or just some of them? Do we try to compete on the categories that other drafters are going for, or ones they are not? Do we embrace high-volatility players or low-volatility players? The problem becomes a rich mathematical one, more familiar to data scientists than to basketball enthusiasts\n",
    "\n",
    "There is plenty of speculation about all this within the fantasy basketball community. However, few in the community realize that their strategies are leveraging high-level mathematical intuition. If we lean into the math, and treat this as an optimization problem, can we derive a method for fantasy drafting that delivers consistently high performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach will be to break down the drafting problem into three mathematical steps\n",
    "- Part one (this notebook): Retrospectively drafting a full previous season, with full knowledge of player performance. Weekly totals will be randomly sampled from actual weekly totals for each player. Fantasy drafting this way becomes a full-information game, and therefore at least one Nash equilibrium exists. However, since in practice the vast majority of players are using approximate strategies rather than attempting to be optimal, we will instead look for strategies that beat common naive strategies\n",
    "- Part two: Using predictive data science methods to make estimates of future performance\n",
    "- Part three: Plug in the results from part two into the algorithms of part one in order to create a drafting strategy that will theoretically work well for real fantasy drafts \n",
    "\n",
    "One other note, before we get started on part one:\n",
    "\n",
    "NBA fantasy drafts require participants to play with a certain number of players at each position, e.g. three centers, plus a few players on the bench who do not count. I've personally found in my (albeit limited) experience that usually I can have all of my players and games count by shifting players to the bench when they are not playing. This would not be the case if my team was totally imbalanced and for example had no centers, but otherwise I think it is a fair assumption. Therefore I will simplify the problem in the following way: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each team must have 3 centers, 1 point guard, 1 shooting guard, 2 guards (either PG or SG), 1 small forward, 1 power forward, 2 forwards (either SF or PF), and 3 utilities (any positions)\n",
    "- Every game played by all of your players count towards your totals"

    "There is one significant wrinkle- free throw percentage and field goal percentage do not work like the other categories, since they are the result of division between two statistics. We can model them a different way. Assuming that each player shoots their average number of shots per game, and their overall percentage is constant throughout the season, then the percentage categories become a sum of binomials (or a Poisson binomial) divided by the number of free throw attempts. The mean of a Poisson binomial is simply the overall weighted mean. The variance of a Poisson binomials is the sum of variance of bernoullis, which can be written as, for example\n",

    "One might argue that the procedure defined above is too greedy because it optimizes winning chances at each step, ignoring players' general value. Ideally we want the optimizer to start by looking at players' general value (total Z+ score), then find players that best fit the team in later rounds. One strategy for this is to make a hybrid score, consisting of both the Gaussian win probability and the Z+ score. Since Z+ scores tend to be larger than win probabilities, we need to include a parameter to de-weight them, which we will call Beta. We can also weigh the Z+ score in a dynamic way, decreasing its importance from 100% to 0% by the last round."
